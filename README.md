# two_wheeler
Hosting code for a two-wheel-in-parallel robot controlled by Arduino. The final robot will be close to a segway but a much smaller scale.

# Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to build a physical test platform to test different control algorithms and estimation methods. So that various control methods and state estimation methods can be compared in a uniformed platform.
