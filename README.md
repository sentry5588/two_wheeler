# two_wheeler
Hosting code for a two-wheel-in-parallel robot controlled by Arduino. The robot will be similar to a segway but in a much smaller scale.

# Why Another Self-Balancing Robot?
Building a physical platform to test and compare various control and estimation algorithms. Almost all existing self-balancing robot uses PID control. I plan to use other control schemes with different robot state estimation methods.

# External Lib
