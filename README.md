# Why Another Self-Balancing Robot?
Building a physical platform to test and compare various control and estimation algorithms. Almost all existing self-balancing robot uses PID control. I plan to use other control schemes with different robot state estimation methods.

# External Libs
LinkedList - Used for debug code communication

ArduinoTimer - Used for timer interrupt

# Note
I decided to use ROS on Raspberry PI instead of Arduino for the robot.
